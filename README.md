# Hangman

This is a Command Line Based Hangman Game, developed using C programming.

## Usage 

This entire project is a game which works on guessing of a word. This program select a word randomly present in a word list.

It counts shows the length of the selected word.

The user will get some chance to guess the word, if the guessed word is coreect it will appear in the exact order of the word.

If wrong letter is given in the input then the program starts hanging the Hangman and also shows how many Lives are left.

The user has 9 (nine) life in the entire game.

## Other files added
- .repl.it this file is added because I have tried running this project online on a platform repl.it which has the capability to run multifile C program.
